# AnUntitledRPG

Yes, that’s the actual title. No, I couldn’t think of anything better. Welcome to my weird little text-based RPG that doesn’t know if it’s a *serious psychological exploration of identity* or just a half-broken game about fighting things with ASCII art.

Spoiler: it’s both.

Spoiler: it sucks.

Spoiler: spoilers ahead.

## What is this?

I don’t know either.

It’s a terminal game where you wander through a dreamlike world, fight monsters, and eventually face the most terrifying enemy imaginable:
**yourself.**

The catch? In the final boss battle, every time you stab the mirror version of you, you also stab yourself. Because why should video games let you feel good about winning?

## Features

* Menus that are *slightly less painful* to navigate than filing your taxes.
* ASCII art that looks like it was drawn by someone with a shaky coffee addiction. (it was.)
* Monsters that may or may not just be reskinned emotional baggage. (they are.)
* A final boss fight that punishes you for doing well. (we call it “immersion.”)
* No microtransactions, unless you count the micro-transaction of your time, patience, and possibly soul.

## How to Play

1. Don’t.
2. Missed step one, didn’t you?
3. Clone/download this mess.
4. Run it in your terminal.
5. Press keys, read words, regret choices.
6. Eventually fight a mirror. Try not to die (you will).

## How *NOT* to Play

* Don’t speedrun it — the only thing you’ll break faster than the timer is the code.
* Don’t expect balance. Enemies are either pushovers or nightmares. No middle ground.
* Don’t ask for multiplayer. The only person you’ll suffer with is yourself.
* Don’t play it at 3am. The mirror boss will feel a little too personal.
* Don’t email me for DLC. The only expansion pack is “disappointment.”

---

## The Plot (kinda)

* You wake up in a dream world.
* You wander around and fight monsters.
* Everyone keeps reminding you that this is all in your head.
* You meet a mirror.
* Surprise: the mirror is you.
* You either win (and wake up) or lose (and stay stuck here forever).

Groundbreaking stuff, I know.

## Bugs / Issues

Yes.

## License

This is under the *“please don’t sue me, I’m just making stuff for fun”* license (technically MIT/Apache-ish, but let’s be real, no one’s profiting from this).

---

## Final Words

This is *AnUntitledRPG*. It’s weird, messy, and probably not fun. But hey — at least it’s honest.
